	Chess.Game$$:
		**Figures$$... Alter movement.
		GameEngine$$

			TwoPlyersEngine##... Start, play, winning condition?? Probably not.
			--Contracts$$... drive things in other related packages in heirarchy.
		
		
		
		**Globals$$... Alter 0, 7, 8 to be variable n.
		Chessboard$$... Might need to not be a grid.
		Controllers$$
			Controller##... To alter the col + row.
		
		
		--Probably Not Players$$
